# RSA Lua Template

This is a template for creating a Lua project for RSA Open Source. The included files provide a README, a license, and a basic project structure which you are welcome to change if you'd like. 

We choose the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) by default since it's simple and permissive, but you are also welcome to change it if you want so long as it isn't a restrictive one. When using this template, be sure to fill in the [year] and [fullname] fields with the correct information.

For information on how to write a README, please see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) on Github-flavored markdown.
